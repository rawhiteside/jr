Tree run: |+
  Run around gathering wood from trees.

  Setup the first time
  -----------------------------
  The "World Path" you specify will be a mixture of corrdinates to run to, and lines that say, "Gather."  These are processed in order.  If it's a coordinate, you'll run to that place.  If it says "Gather", you'll it'll gather wood from the "next" pinned tree menu (more on that in a min.)  Sometimes, you'll need several waypoints in the path to get across a bridge, or around an obstacle before the next "Gather."

  For the first setup, then, go to the first tree.  Add the coordinates.  Then pick up the tree menu, and pin it somewhere.  I use the bottom left corner.  You're going to stack up all of these menus in the same spot.  Now, press "Gather" to add that to the path.

  Continue on along your path, adding waypoints and "Gathers" as appropriate.  Continue stacking up the tree menus all atop each other.

  You'll need to pin the bonfire menu somewhere along the bottom of the screen, too.  Wood gets stashed at the *end* of the route, so you must be near the bonfire at the end of the path.

  Start the macro.  It'll tile the tree menus and run around gathering.

  Subsequent setups.
  -----------------------------
  The path is already set up, so all you need do this time is to run around picking up the tree menus.  These MUST be in the same order you set up originally!

Flimsy Bricks: "Uses a 5x5 array, but can't reach the corners, so those unused. \n\
  \n- Setup:\n- Hotkeys ON. \n- Hold boards, straw, etc. \n- Put a brickrack 4 small\

  \ defining the 5x5 grid:\n- - The two points should be ON the two brickracks, near\
  \ the LOWER RIGHT of the brickracks.  This point is visible, even if bricks pile\
  \ up. \n\n"
Color Picker: "Forget why I wrote this.\n\nPick a point, then start the macro. \n\
  It watches that point, and pops a dialog, which updates itself with the color values\
  \ of that point. \n\nProbably seemed like a good idea at the time. "
Global setup: "Global setup/preferences.\n\nSkills window.\nOK, this is a hack. Leave\

Travel paths: "This defines safe walking routes between waypoints.  These routes should\
  \ have names of the form \"<A> to <B>\", as in \"Guildhall to Expedition Site\"\n\
  \nThese routes are used by the \"Travel\" macro to travel.  If you want to go from\
  \ camp to the Chariot, it can chain together these routes, so you may travel Guildhall\
  \ -> Expedition Site -> Limestone -> Chariot.  \n\nAwkwardly, the names of the waypoints\
  \ must match exactly, so look at the existing names if you want to grow the network.\
  \ \n"
Travel: "This will travel to a named destination. It works like this:\n- Read in the\
  \ defined \"Travel route\" setups.\n\n- Find all the possible chains or these that\
  \ terminate at the destination. \n\n- Find the line segment in any of these that\
  \ is nearest to your current location. \n\n- If there are several such line segments\
  \ within a couple of coordinates of you, choose the one with the shortest total\
  \ length.\n\n- Walk to the line segment, then follow the defined routes to the destination.\

Walk: "Walk to the provided coordinates. \n\nTODO:  Read coordinates from main.  (I.e.,\
