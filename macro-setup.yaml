Tree run: |+
  Run around gathering wood from trees.

  Setup the first time
  -----------------------------
  The "World Path" you specify will be a mixture of corrdinates to run to, and lines that say, "Gather."  These are processed in order.  If it's a coordinate, you'll run to that place.  If it says "Gather", you'll it'll gather wood from the "next" pinned tree menu (more on that in a min.)  Sometimes, you'll need several waypoints in the path to get across a bridge, or around an obstacle before the next "Gather."

  For the first setup, then, go to the first tree.  Add the coordinates.  Then pick up the tree menu, and pin it somewhere.  I use the bottom left corner.  You're going to stack up all of these menus in the same spot.  Now, press "Gather" to add that to the path.

  Continue on along your path, adding waypoints and "Gathers" as appropriate.  Continue stacking up the tree menus all atop each other.

  You'll need to pin the bonfire menu somewhere along the bottom of the screen, too.  Wood gets stashed at the *end* of the route, so you must be near the bonfire at the end of the path.

  Start the macro.  It'll tile the tree menus and run around gathering.

  Subsequent setups.
  -----------------------------
  The path is already set up, so all you need do this time is to run around picking up the tree menus.  These MUST be in the same order you set up originally!
